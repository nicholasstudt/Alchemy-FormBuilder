FormBuilder version 0.43
========================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DATABASE

  Load the appropriate schema file into your database according to your
  particular database's methods. Note that the schema files contain only
  the table and sequence schema, they do not contain any authorization
  information for the database. It is up to the installer to set these to
  their desired preference.

  There is a data file that accompanies the distribution - you will need to
  load the appropriate file (FormBuilder.*.data) for the application to 
  function properly.

  There is also an examples file that may be loaded for form examples,
  (FormBuilder.*.examples).

  If you are going to take advantage of the KrKit::Help system, be sure to
  load the accompanying help data file (Help.*.data).

APACHE

  Configure your apache installation for mod_perl and Alchemy FormBuilder,
  see the FormBuilder.conf file for an example configuration.

  "perldoc Alchemy::FormBuilder" details all of the configuration options.

  Copy or create templates for your installation of FormBuilder. The
  default templates are located in the docs directory of the source
  distribution - also is an accompanying style sheet.

  After these steps have been completed you have a new way to introduce
  forms to the web with an accompanying back-end for parsing and handling
  the output from these forms.

  Be sure to review the FormBuilder.conf file for the necessary SetVars - some
  of the variables are specific to your directory structure - for those
  directories that are annotated - the user/owner of the apache web process
  will need to have read/write access in order for the application's save
  features to work - especially those associated with file upload.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  mod_perl 1.x
  
  KrKit
  POSIX
  Apache2::Request
  Text::Wrap
  Net::SMTP
  MIME::Lite
  File::Copy
  File::Path

DIRECTORY DATA

With the way this application works - in order to save data and still make
it so that a regular user has access ... the following is suggested:
  Make the apache web server user a member of the group that has access to
  the designated directories.
  The save directories need to be group r/w:
    chmod 0775 <directory name>
	or
	chmod 0775 `find ./ -type d`
  In order to cause the files added/directories created to maintain permissions,
  set the sgid bit:
    chmod g+s <directory name>
	or
	chmod g+s `find ./ -type d`
It's just a suggestion....

Have fun and good luck - 8)
