Revision history for Perl extension Alchemy::FormBuilder.

Todo:
	- Limit output file formats to csv and xml. These two formats allow
	  the maximum possible utility. 
	- See about making the form creation take just a file and not make
	  the user generate the form element by elment.

	  To 'upgrade' need only dump the existing table:
	      pg_dump -aD -t form_types -f ftypes.sql <table_name>
	  Edit the dump file - change the following names (old => new):
	      type_name     => type
		  row_count     => row
		  col_count     => col
		  size_count    => size
		  max_length    => max
		  checked       => checkd
		  readonly      => read
		  multiple      => mult
		  tab_index     => tab
		  css_class     => css
	  Then drop the old table:
	      DROP TABLE form_types;
		  DROP SEQUENCE form_types_sequence;
	  And add the new:
	      create sequence "form_types_sequence";
	      create table "form_types" (
	        "id" integer primary key not null
	          default nextval( 'form_types_sequence' ),
	        "type" varchar,
	        "name" varchar default '0',
	        "value" varchar default '0',
	        "row" varchar default '0',
	        "col" varchar default '0',
	        "size" varchar default '0',
	        "max" varchar default '0',
	        "checkd" varchar default '0',
	        "read" varchar default '0',
	        "mult" varchar default '0',
	        "tab" varchar default '0',
            "css" varchar default '0',
            "src" varchar default '0',
            "alt" varchar default '0'
          );
	  Finally, add back the original data so that the indices remain unchanged
	      pgsql -U apache -f ftypes.sql <table_name>
	- Rebuilt module into a more proper set up - using lib for the modules
	- Will need to remove "none" entry from form_validate - can do through gui
	- Added templating for text and html file output
	  Requires two columns to be added to the form_data database, txt_templ and

	      alter table form_data add column "txt_templ" text;
		  alter table form_data add column "html_templ" text;
